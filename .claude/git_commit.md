Git commit the current staged changes. Do not add any unstaged changes to the commit. If any issues arise via the pre-commit scripts, carefully review the error message and the current code and implement the fixes.

Never commit directly to the `main` branch even when asked to; it's likely a mistake. If you were on the `main` branch, ALWAYS create a new branch first.
