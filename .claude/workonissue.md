Carefully read the issue $ARGUMENTS and think of how you can implement it. Plan first, create your own branch and then implement step by step. Then stage your changes and git commit to your branch. If any errors or warnings arise from the pre-commit hook, fix them as well. Then create a pull request of your branch into `main` using the `gh` command.

Finally, document your key learnings by updating @CLAUDE.md and or the `docs`. After implementing the solution, reflect on the process. Compare your initial assumptions with the final outcome. Document any surprises, incorrect assumptions, or unexpected challenges you faced. Focus on the gap between expectation and realityâ€”there's no need to document what went as planned.

Never push your commits or create pull requests until I've reviewed them. Never commit directly to the `main` branch.
