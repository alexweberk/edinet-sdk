## Instructions
Write a feature spec, given the following user story or feature request. Do not implement it yet. The feature spec will be implemented by a junior developer, so keep the feature set to a minimum, and use clear, concise structure and wording. Save your feature spec in a file first, then upload it as a Github issue, using the `gh` command line tool.

## How to create an issue
- You can create a Github issue using the `gh` command line tool.
- Because of commonly occurring formatting errors from the `gh` tool, you will first save your content in a temporary file and specify that as the body for your `gh` command
- Then remove the temporary file.

## Keep in mind
- Spec should follow architecture and implementation patterns seen in the current project to maintain code consistency
- Follow domain driven development principles to maximize future maintainability
